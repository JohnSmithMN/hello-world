# hello-world
Hello world of GitHub!

I'm working with the city of Missoula, Montana (USA) to build a performance dashboard of city data. I'm pushing to move the city to take on an open data policy and to make this dashboard and it's source files publicly accesible and downloadable. Do you have advice? Examples? Code? Storeis from your own efforts in other cities or organizations? I'm open to it all.
